## What is Exploratory Data Analysis?


Exploratory Data Analysis or (EDA) is understanding the data sets by summarizing their main characteristics often plotting them visually. This step is very important especially when we arrive at modeling the data in order to apply Machine learning. Plotting in EDA consists of Histograms, Box plot, Scatter plot and many more. It often takes much time to explore the data. Through the process of EDA, we can ask to define the problem statement or definition on our data set which is very important.


## Dataset


To give a piece of brief information about the data set this data contains more of 10, 000 rows and more than 10 columns which contains features of the car such as Engine Fuel Type, Engine Size, HP, Transmission Type, highway MPG, city MPG and many more.

## Histogram

Histogram refers to the frequency of occurrence of variables in an interval. In this case, there are mainly 10 different types of car manufacturing companies, but it is often important to know who has the most number of cars. To do this histogram is one of the trivial solutions which lets us know the total number of car manufactured by a different company.

## Heat Maps

Heat Maps is a type of plot which is necessary when we need to find the dependent variables. One of the best way to find the relationship between the features can be done using heat maps. In the below heat map we know that the price feature depends mainly on the Engine Size, Horsepower, and Cylinders.

## Scatterplot

We generally use scatter plots to find the correlation between two variables. Here the scatter plots are plotted between Horsepower and Price and we can see the plot below. With the plot given below, we can easily draw a trend line. These features provide a good scattering of points.
